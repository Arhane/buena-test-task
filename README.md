# Bueno Test task

## How to run
`npm install --ci`
`npm run start`

## Technical decisions
- I used `create-react-app` to bootstrap the project
- I used `react-router-dom` to handle routing
- I didn't use any state management library because the app is small and the state is not complex
- I used tailwindcss to style the app and keep the styling simple and responsive
- I added the localStorage to persist the state of the app
- I used native components to keep the app accessible. As a bonus, the native components support autocomplete

## What I would do differently
- I would add tests
- I would add validation to the form
- I would move the css to separate files
